# Lab 5 - Spring AOP

You can continue to your last lab assignment to implement followings.

###  Requirements
--- 
* Make a `ActivityLog` database table (`id,date,operation,duration`) that will store all methods that have `ExecutionTime` annotations.
* Make an `Aspect` that has an annotation pointcut `@ExecutionTime`, when placed on a method, it calculates the time taken to complete that method and writes it to `ActivityLog` table.
* Make an `Aspect` that has an pointcut for classes in `edu.miu.service` package to check if `POST` requests has `AOP-IS-AWESOME` header. If the header is not present then throw a `AopIsAwesomeHeaderException`.

### Technical Details
---
* Use n-tier software architecture model.
* Use DTOs.
* PostgreSQL is recommended as a Relational Database system.
* Populate your database with dummy data using `data.sql`.


## Submission

* Fork the repository and push your changes.
* Once you finished your project, send a Pull Request. (Send only one Pull Request once you finish the assignment.)

### Important Notes
---

 * You are not allowed to share codes with your classmates. If detected, you will get NC.
 * **For pairs:**
	 * Individual's work will be checked from the commits.
	 *  Share tasks evenly and fairly.
	 *  To have a clearer understanding of pair programming:
		 *  > **Pair programming** is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the _driver_, writes code while the other, the _observer_ or _navigator_ reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. 
		 * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming#:~:text=Pair%20programming%20is%20an%20agile,two%20programmers%20switch%20roles%20frequently.)

-   Remember to respect the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original. Presenting something as oneâ€™s own work when it came from another source is plagiarism and is forbidden.
    
-   Plagiarism is a very serious thing in all American academic institutions and is guarded against vigilantly by every professor.
